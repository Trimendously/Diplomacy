## Usage
WIP
## Context
A web application developed to provide a dynamic and interactive user experience
### Front-End
* SASS/CSS
* HTML
* Javascript
* Node.js
### Back-end
* ASP.NET MVC
* Azure SQL Database
### Scripting
* C#
* Python (maybe for map)
### Hosting
*Microsoft Azure

## Problems
The interactive map (essentially a png made interactive) is the centermost challenge for this project.
To address this I have poised several potential solutions of which I will attempt implementing over the coming weeks:
* [HTML Image Maps](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_images_imagemap.asp)
* [SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG)
## Future
- [ ] Add interactive map
- [ ] Further improve UI for identity pages
- [ ] Figure out the appropriate color scheme for the site to base further UI improvements around
- [ ] Add external authentication via (Google, Facebook, Twitter, maybe more)



## Contributing
I am open to contribution this is my first .NET project and quite a big undertaking as I've never worked on a client-server method for network play.
